# Find-Your-Lead

## Project Description

My app is called FindYourLead. It's a recipe app for people who have a hard time figuring out what to eat. Users can see a massive variety of ingredients by just filtering out what ingredients they have or are willing to buy, or filtering out the cultural (location based) recipes they may lean towards. In the future, I'd like to add a feature so that users can see where people making the same recipe can come together and cook together.
