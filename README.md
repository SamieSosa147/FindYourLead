# A-lil-Bit-Salty

## Project Description

Our  app is called A-lil-Bit-Salty. It is picture based food app for people with a uniqie TASTE of humor. The app alows users to submit comments under not-so-attractive foods.  Users can select specific pictures they want to comment under. The kicker is, users can update, or even delete anyones comments.It is a community of satire commenting on disgusting images of "delicuous" meals.  In the future, we would like to add a feature that allows user's contents as well user authentication, a feature that would only allow  a specific user to edit, or delete their own comment.
